A utility to crop PDF pages, getting rid of the useless blank margins.  I have loads of books on my Kindle which I find hard work to read, with tiny font sizes.  They are PDF files, scanned from text books etc, and so the text is an image.  I have had some success with OCR in the past, but it tends to cause unacceptable compromises when it comes to images, and more.  Jan Meeus's Astronomical Algorithms was the last straw, with absolutely huge gaps around the text, and very poor quality scanning.  This utility attempts to crop things out, but also sharpen text, and make it more bold.
